## 4.1 Two Schools of Thought: Passive vs Active

### Passive Investing
**Philosophy:** Markets are efficient; nobody can consistently beat them. Just capture market returns at low cost.

**Strategy:**
- Buy and hold index funds
- Minimal trading
- Low costs
- Long-term focus

**Best For:** 90% of individual investors

### Active Investing
**Philosophy:** Markets have inefficiencies that skilled investors can exploit for higher returns.

**Strategy:**
- Research and select individual stocks
- Attempt to beat the market
- Higher costs and effort
- Requires significant skill and time

**Best For:** Those with expertise, time, and genuine interest

### The Verdict

**My Recommendation:**

## 4.2 Systematic Investment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Rupee Cost Averaging (SIP)

**How it works:** Invest fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions.

**Example:** ₹10,000 SIP monthly

| Month | NAV | Units Purchased | Total Units | Value |
|-------|-----|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Jan | ₹100 | 100 | 100 | ₹10,000 |
| Feb | ₹90 | 111 | 211 | ₹18,990 |
| Mar | ₹80 | 125 | 336 | ₹26,880 |
| Apr | ₹85 | 118 | 454 | ₹38,590 |
| May | ₹95 | 105 | 559 | ₹53,105 |
| Jun | ₹100 | 100 | 659 | ₹65,900 |

**Invested:** ₹60,000 | **Value:** ₹65,900 | **Avg Cost:** ₹91.05/unit

**Benefits:**
- Removes timing decisions
- Buys more when cheap, less when expensive
- Builds discipline
- Works for everyone

### Strategy 2: Lumpsum + SIP Combination

**When you have a lumpsum:**
- Don't put everything in at once
- Use Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)
- Transfer from liquid fund to equity over 6-12 months

**Example:** Have ₹3,00,000 lumpsum
```
Month 1-6:
├── Park ₹3,00,000 in Liquid Fund
└── STP ₹50,000/month to Equity Fund

Benefits:
├── Liquid fund earns 5-6% while waiting
├── Equity exposure built gradually
└── Reduces sequence of returns risk
```

### Strategy 3: Value Averaging

**How it works:** Vary investment amount to achieve target portfolio value.

**Example:** Target growth ₹10,000/month

| Month | Target Value | Actual Value | Investment Needed |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | ₹10,000 | ₹0 | ₹10,000 |
| 2 | ₹20,000 | ₹9,500 | ₹10,500 |
| 3 | ₹30,000 | ₹22,000 | ₹8,000 |
| 4 | ₹40,000 | ₹35,000 | ₹5,000 |
| 5 | ₹50,000 | ₹42,000 | ₹8,000 |

**Benefits:** Forces buying more in falling markets, less in rising markets.

## 4.4 Value Investing: Buy Low, Sell High

### Core Philosophy
> "Price is what you pay, value is what you get." - Warren Buffett

Find companies trading below their intrinsic value and wait for market to recognize the value.

### Value Investing Checklist

```
VALUE INVESTING CHECKLIST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUANTITATIVE SCREENS
□ P/E below industry average
□ P/B below 2 (ideally < 1.5)
□ PEG ratio below 1
□ Debt/Equity below 0.5
□ ROE above 15%
□ Dividend yield above 2%

```

### Calculating Intrinsic Value (Simplified DCF)

**Discounted Cash Flow Method:**
```
Intrinsic Value = Future Cash Flows / (1 + Discount Rate)^n

Simplified version:
Value = Current Earnings × Growth Multiplier × Margin of Safety

Example: Company XYZ
├── Current EPS: ₹50
├── Expected growth: 15% for 10 years
├── Terminal P/E: 15
├── Discount rate: 12%
├── Intrinsic Value: ~₹1,200
├── Current Price: ₹800
└── Margin of Safety: 33% ✓ BUY
```

### Key Concepts

#### Support and Resistance

- Should **not replace** fundamental analysis
- Best used together: **"Fundamentals for WHAT, Technicals for WHEN"**
- For most investors: **Just SIP and ignore charts**

## 4.7 Dividend Investing Strategy

### Why Dividends Matter

1. **Regular income** without selling

5. **Tax efficiency** - Dividends up to ₹10 lakh taxed at 10%

### Dividend Stock Selection Criteria

| Criteria | Good Value | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| **Dividend Yield** | 2-6% | Not too low, not too high |
| **Payout Ratio** | 30-60% | Sustainable, room to grow |
| **Dividend Growth** | > 8% CAGR | Beats inflation |
| **Consecutive Years** | > 10 years | Reliability |

Year    Dividend    Reinvested    Portfolio Value
────────────────────────────────────────────────
1       ₹40,000     Yes           ₹10,80,000
