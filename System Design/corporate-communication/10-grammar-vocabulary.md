# Grammar & Vocabulary Reference

## Why Grammar Matters

Clear grammar = clear thinking. As an engineer, your ideas are only as good as your ability to communicate them.

**Good grammar:**
- Builds credibility
- Prevents misunderstandings
- Shows professionalism
- Makes you easier to understand
- Advances your career

## Common Grammar Mistakes

### 1. Your vs You're

**Your** = possessive (belonging to you)
**You're** = you are

✅ **Correct:**
- "Your code is ready for review"
- "You're going to love this feature"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Your going to the meeting" → You're going to the meeting
- "You're code needs testing" → Your code needs testing

### 2. Its vs It's

**Its** = possessive (belonging to it)
**It's** = it is / it has

✅ **Correct:**
- "The API has reached its limit"
- "It's working perfectly now"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Its a great solution" → It's a great solution
- "The system lost it's connection" → The system lost its connection

### 3. There, Their, They're

**There** = location
**Their** = possessive (belonging to them)
**They're** = they are

✅ **Correct:**
- "The server is over there"
- "Their code passed all tests"
- "They're deploying on Friday"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "There deploying today" → They're deploying today
- "Their are three options" → There are three options

### 4. Affect vs Effect

**Affect** = verb (to influence)
**Effect** = noun (the result)

✅ **Correct:**
- "This bug affects 10% of users" (verb)
- "The effect was immediate" (noun)
- "We need to effect change" (verb - rare usage, means "to bring about")

❌ **Wrong:**
- "What's the affect?" → What's the effect?
- "This will effect performance" → This will affect performance

### 5. Then vs Than

**Then** = related to time
**Than** = comparison

✅ **Correct:**
- "First we test, then we deploy"
- "PostgreSQL is faster than MongoDB"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Better then the old version" → Better than the old version
- "We deployed, than we monitored" → We deployed, then we monitored

### 6. Less vs Fewer

**Less** = uncountable things
**Fewer** = countable things

✅ **Correct:**
- "Less time" (uncountable)
- "Fewer bugs" (countable)
- "Less memory usage"
- "Fewer API calls"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Less errors" → Fewer errors
- "Fewer latency" → Less latency

### 7. Who vs Whom

**Who** = subject (doing the action)
**Whom** = object (receiving the action)

**Trick:** If you can replace it with he/she, use who. If you can replace it with him/her, use whom.

✅ **Correct:**
- "Who wrote this code?" (He wrote it)
- "To whom should I send this?" (Send it to him)

**Modern usage:** In casual communication, "who" is often acceptable for both. Use "whom" in formal writing.

### 8. That vs Which

**That** = essential information (restrictive)
**Which** = additional information (non-restrictive)

✅ **Correct:**
- "The bug that caused the crash is fixed" (essential - which bug?)
- "The API, which we launched yesterday, is performing well" (additional info)

**Trick:** If you need a comma, use "which". If not, use "that".

### 9. Me vs I

**I** = subject
**Me** = object

**Trick:** Remove the other person and see if it makes sense.

✅ **Correct:**
- "Sarah and I will review the code" (I will review)
- "Send the document to Jordan and me" (Send to me)

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Me and Sarah reviewed it" → Sarah and I reviewed it
- "Between you and I" → Between you and me

### 10. Could of vs Could have

**Could have** = correct
**Could of** = NEVER correct (it's a mishearing of "could've")

✅ **Correct:**
- "I could have fixed it earlier"
- "We should have tested more"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "Could of done better" → Could have done better
- "Should of known" → Should have known

## Sentence Structure

### Active vs Passive Voice

**Active voice:** Subject performs the action (preferred)
**Passive voice:** Subject receives the action (use sparingly)

✅ **Active (better):**
- "I fixed the bug"
- "The team deployed the feature"
- "Sarah wrote the documentation"

❌ **Passive (weaker):**
- "The bug was fixed"
- "The feature was deployed"
- "The documentation was written"

**When to use passive:**
- When the actor is unknown: "The server was compromised"
- When the actor doesn't matter: "The code was reviewed"
- To avoid blame: "A mistake was made" (though active is more honest)

### Parallel Structure

When listing items, keep the structure consistent.

✅ **Correct:**
- "The app is fast, reliable, and scalable"
- "We need to test, deploy, and monitor"

❌ **Wrong:**
- "The app is fast, reliable, and has scalability" (mixing adjectives and verb)
- "We need to test, deployment, and monitoring" (mixing verb forms)

### Subject-Verb Agreement

Subject and verb must match in number.

✅ **Correct:**
- "The code works" (singular)
- "The tests pass" (plural)
- "Each developer has their own setup"
- "The team is ready" (team = singular)

❌ **Wrong:**
- "The code work" → works
- "The tests passes" → pass
- "The team are ready" → is ready (in American English; "are" is acceptable in British English)

Task: I needed to prevent a service outage
Action: I analyzed table sizes, archived old data, and implemented 
        automated cleanup scripts
Result: Reduced database size by 40%, preventing downtime and saving $50K 
        in infrastructure costs
```

### The Before-After Format

**Before:** Describe the old state
**After:** Describe the new state
**Impact:** Quantify the improvement

**Example:**
```
Before: Manual deployments took 4 hours and failed 20% of the time
